Welcome to my IT Engineering Portfolio website :)
Since I started this career path in 2012 at the University of Montana, I have always dreamed 
of giving back to young men and women starting their jorney in IT. My experience
at the university was very rewarding and I look back fondly at it. My first exposure to 
the Linux operating system was in a class about VoIP Telephony. I vividly remember now in 2025,
13 years ago, when Professor Steven Stiff introduced the class to the Astrisk Linux operating system,
and more specifically the Asterisk PBX. 

I became fascinated at the concept of downloading an operating system for free, taking bare hardware,
and having a completely free operating system that performed faster than Windows on older hardware.
Not to mention, hooking up a bunch of Cisco IP phones to a system you built from scratch is a highly
rewarding feeling. I do recommend it. 

From there my love and fascination for Linux was born. Over the next weeks I  started to research Linux 
Distros and what the process was to install them on random computers. I had never felt so much like a
hacker :D 

Linux remained a side hobby for me as I began my IT career. 
I started out at the university as a systems administrator. I got exposed to what was called a "render farm"
for the first time, which I realize now is similar to any distributed computer clustering. But at the time I 
felt like I was working on the future of the world, it was intense. We would build nodes from scratch and thats
when my computer building hobby started to excel. 

I did a project to build a pfsense network firewall, ordering all of the pertinant hardware, building the system,
installing pfsense, and configuring the firewall on my networks. As worked on side projects, I always wished I had
a catalog of my work on the internet where I could share experiences and parts of my IT jorney with others. 
Finally having this started feels great.
